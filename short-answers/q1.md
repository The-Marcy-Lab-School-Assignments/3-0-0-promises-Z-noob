# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
'Outside promise' is printed first, because it's executed synchronously. Then, 'Inside promise' is printed. Triggered by the .then() callback resolution of the promise, even though it's immediately and the asynchronous nature of it.
