# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
(a) and (b) is true. That's because (a) produce a value or a reason for the promise. They are the executor function for the promise function, The promise executor function itself is expected to return either a value or another promise. When a value is returned, the promise will be resolved with that value. If you return another promise, the resolution of the current promise will be chained to the resolution of the returned promise.
