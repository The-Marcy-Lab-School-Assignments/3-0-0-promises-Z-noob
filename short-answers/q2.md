# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
.then() and .catch() are both methods used in JavaScript promises to handle the outcome of asynchronous operations. . `then()` is used to handle the fulfillment of the promise and can takes two optional parameters. Whereas `.catch()` occurs  when the promise is rejected and takes only one parameter. Both methods return a promise, allowing for method chaining. While `.then()` can handle both the fulfillment and rejection of promises, `.catch()` specifically focuses on handling promise rejections.
