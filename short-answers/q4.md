# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
The arguments that passes into resolve/reject become the data that they evaluate to if either is executed. The evaluation is the promise transitions from the pending state to the accepted/rejected state. Then using this data the attached `.then()` or `.catch()` handlers will be activated for they're respective reason.
